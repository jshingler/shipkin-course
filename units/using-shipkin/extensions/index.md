# Extensions

Shipkin currently offers an extension to markdown which can insert code
directly from the codebases included in your `unit.json` file.
Use the extension by inserting the following snippet anywhere in a
markdown file.

```markdown
{{codebase-file codebase="prerequisite-code" path="build.gradle" lang="groovy" ref="master" hidden="false"}}
```

-   `codebase`: The codebase when the file is located, as listed in the
    `unit.json` file.
-   `path`: the path to the file relative to the codebase root.
-   `ref`: the branch or tag for the file.
-   `lang`: the programming language the code is in for highlighting.
-   `hidden`: boolean that specifies if the included file is visible,
    default is _true_.

The included file will look as follows.

{{codebase-file codebase="prerequisite-code" path="build.gradle" lang="groovy" ref="master" hidden="false"}}
